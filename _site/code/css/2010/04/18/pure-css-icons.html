	<h2 class="entry--title">Pure CSS Icons</h2>

	<p>Having marvelled at <a href="http://desandro.com/articles/opera-logo-css/">David Desandro's Opera Logo</a> made entirely in HTML and CSS, I wanted to try a similar experiment for myself. So with a large scoop of border-radius I set about trying to create various 'common' icons that could be used in your web apps.</p>

<p>To skip all the explanation and view these icons in their entirety, <a href="http://rathersplendid.net/cssicons/">click for the demo</a></p>

<h3>CSS3</h3>

<p>These icons use lots of CSS3, border-radius being the most obvious but also rotation, gradients and transform (for when an icon is hovered over).</p>

<h3>Size?</h3>

<p>These icons needed to be functional and useful for the web, so all dimensions are em-based so that all you have to do to change the size of the icon is just change the font-size of their containing element.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>I'm sure its obvious but just to be clear, these icons will not work very well in Internet Explorer.</p>

<h4>RSS</h4>

<p>My first idea was simply an RSS icon, it seemed easy enough and indeed it was. I created a two variations, one with the traditional orange background and one without.
<img src="/img/posts/211.png" alt="RSS" /></p>

<h4>Heart</h4>

<p>Made with just two spans rotated at opposite angles.
<img src="/img/posts/210.png" alt="Heart" /></p>

<h4>iPhone</h4>

<p>With a big dose of inspiration from the brilliant <a href="http://helveticons.ch">Helveticons</a> icon set, I created this iPhone icon. Three spans within one container div.
<img src="/img/posts/209.png" alt="iPhone" /></p>

<h4>Microphone</h4>

<p>Easily the most interesting icon to code, this icon uses a few more elements than any of the others.
<img src="/img/posts/208.png" alt="Heart" /></p>

<h4>Block</h4>

<p>A simple div with a rotated span within.
<img src="/img/posts/207.png" alt="Block" /></p>

<h4>Triangle</h4>

<p>One div that make uses borders to create the illusion of a triangle.
<img src="/img/posts/206.png" alt="Triangle" /></p>

<h4>Disc, Target &amp; Mini Target</h4>

<p><img src="/img/posts/205.png" alt="Triangle" /></p>

<h4>Can &amp; upright can</h4>

<p>Variations on the disc and target icons; I found it quite interesting to see what happens when you changes the dimensions of their containers. If it was wider, I think the Can could be used quite effectively as a button.
<img src="/img/posts/204.png" alt="Triangle" /></p>

<h4>Eye</h4>

<p>Without a doubt, my favourite of all the icons, it only uses one container and a span within. I had initially tried to use one span for the larger circle shap, two spans for each of the points and another for the 'pupil' of the eye. I quickly realised that this was not needed and instead created a box with two very rounded corners, then I rotated it 45 degrees and inserted the inner span for the pupil. Neat huh?
<img src="/img/posts/203.png" alt="Triangle" /></p>

<h3>An interesting discovery or maybe just my incompetence..</h3>

<p>I tried these icons out on an iPhone and found a peculiar problem, it seems the iPhone cannot handle particularly large rounded corners, take a look at the screengrab to the left to see what I mean. Does anyone know why or if I have made an error? Please enlighten me.
<img src="/img/posts/202.png" alt="Triangle" /></p>

<p>I do intend on exploring this idea further, but I would love to know what everyone's thoughts and suggestions are; can these be impoved or created using less code..?</p>
